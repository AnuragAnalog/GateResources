# Gate Resources

These notes are from Gate Applied AI and for Computer and Information Sciences.

I have uploaded in [archive.org](https://archive.org) so that everyone can easily access them. You can also download the complete GATE CSE syllabus notes at this link: [https://archive.org/details/gate-applied-ai-notes](https://archive.org/details/gate-applied-ai-notes)

> Complete syllabus file is huge (530 MB)

Under each topic I have also included the links of the some video playlists which I found easy to understand.
> These are not the only videos which can be used
